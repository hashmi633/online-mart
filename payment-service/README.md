# Payment Service

---

## Overview

The Payment Service handles payment processing, verification, and integration with third-party payment gateways. It ensures seamless order payment updates, refunds, and failure handling while maintaining security and reliability.

---

## Features

### 1. Payment Processing
- **Initiate Payment**: Start the payment process for an order.
- **Verify Payment**: Verify the status of a payment (successful, failed, or pending).
- **Refund Management**: Handle refund requests and processing.
- **Payment Methods**:
  - Support for multiple payment methods such as credit/debit cards, bank transfers, and mobile wallets.

### 2. Order Integration
- **Order Status Update**:
  - Automatically update order status based on payment success or failure.
  - Notify the Order Service of payment events.

### 3. Security
- **Tokenized Payment Data**:
  - Use tokenization for secure storage of payment details.
- **Fraud Detection**:
  - Basic fraud detection for suspicious transactions.

### 4. Notification
- Notify users of payment status changes via the Notification Service.

## Kafka Topics

- **payment_initiation**: For initiating payment requests.
- **payment_status**: Publishes updates on payment status (success, failure, or pending).
- **refund_request**: For handling refund events and statuses.

---

## Models

### Payment Model
- **payment_id**: Unique identifier for the payment.
- **order_id**: Reference to the related order.
- **user_id**: Reference to the user making the payment.
- **amount**: Total payment amount.
- **payment_status**: Status of the payment (`success`, `failure`, `pending`).
- **payment_method**: Chosen payment method (e.g., `credit_card`, `wallet`).
- **transaction_id**: Identifier from the payment gateway.

### Refund Model
- **refund_id**: Unique identifier for the refund request.
- **payment_id**: Reference to the related payment.
- **amount**: Amount to be refunded.
- **refund_status**: Status of the refund (`initiated`, `processed`, `failed`).
- **reason**: Reason for the refund request.

## API Endpoints

### Payment Endpoints
- **POST** `/initiate-payment`: Start a payment for an order.
- **GET** `/payment/{payment_id}`: Get payment details by ID.
- **POST** `/verify-payment`: Verify the status of a payment.
- **POST** `/refund`: Initiate a refund for a payment.

### Admin Endpoints
- **GET** `/payments`: List all payments.
- **GET** `/refunds`: List all refund requests.

---

## Workflow

### Payment Workflow
1. **Initiation**:
   - User submits a payment request via `/initiate-payment`.
   - The service validates the order details and calculates the required payment amount.
   - The payment request is sent to the payment gateway.
2. **Verification**:
   - The service listens to the `payment_status` Kafka topic for updates on the payment status.
   - Updates the order status in the Order Service based on the payment result.
3. **Notification**:
   - Publishes payment status updates to the Notification Service for user communication.

### Refund Workflow
1. **Request**:
   - User submits a refund request via `/refund`.
   - The service validates the request against the original payment details.
2. **Processing**:
   - Refund is processed and published to the `refund_request` Kafka topic.
   - Refund status is updated, and notifications are sent to the user.

## Technologies

- **FastAPI**: Framework for building APIs.
- **Kafka**: Message broker for inter-service communication.
- **SQLModel**: ORM for database interactions.
- **Third-Party Payment Gateway APIs**: For processing payments securely.

---

## Security Measures

1. **Encryption**:
   - All sensitive data, such as payment details, are encrypted in transit and at rest.
2. **Fraud Prevention**:
   - Implement basic checks to prevent duplicate or suspicious transactions.
3. **Tokenization**:
   - Use tokenization for payment methods to avoid storing raw card details.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Retry Mechanism**:
   - Implement a retry mechanism for failed payments.
2. **Payment Analytics**:
   - Track payment trends and generate reports.
3. **Multi-Currency Support**:
   - Allow payments in different currencies with automatic conversion.
4. **Advanced Fraud Detection**:
   - Integrate AI/ML for fraud detection.
5. **User Wallet**:
   - Provide a wallet system for faster payments and refunds.

This is a proposed blueprint for the Payment Service. The actual implementation may evolve based on system requirements and business needs.
